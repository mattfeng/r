# Glossary

## A

- **AP-MS**.
  - affinity purification-mass spectrometry

## C

- **Co-IP**.
  - co-immunoprecipitation
- **complementation assay**.
  - an assay that works by recovering functionality _only when_ all parts are present
  - an example of a complementation assay is the **yeast two-hybrid** method
    for probing protein-protein interactions
  - this is analagous to **complementation** in genetics, where the wild-type
    phenotype is recovered from two different homozygous recessive mutants

## L

- **LC-MS**.
  - liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry

## M

- **MALDI**.
  - matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
